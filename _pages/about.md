Hi! I'm Kangrui Du, a first-year M.S. in Computational Science and Engineering at College of Computing, [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), where I was a member of [Brain and Intelligence Lab](https://guslab.org/) at [(UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Shi Gu](https://guslab.org/). I was a research intern at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/) where I'm fortunate to work with [Prof. Shujun Wang](https://emma-sjwang.github.io/).

My current research interests mainly lie in building systems for fast and efficient machine learning. I'm also interested in programing contests and traditional algorithms, and was a member of UESTC ACM-ICPC team.

Temporal Flexibility in Spiking Neural Networks: Towards Generalization Across Time Steps and Deployment Friendliness

**\*Kangrui Du**, \*Yuhang Wu, Shikuang Deng, Shi Gu

[*Old version*](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RmQAKu1wCe) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- Existing direct training methods are confined to a fixed timestep, which hinders on-chip dynamic energy-performance balancing and renders the models incompatible with fully event-driven chips.
- Design *Mixed Timestep Training* to train *Temporal Flexible SNNs* compatible with varied temporal structures.
- TFSNN exhibits near-SOTA performance, generalization across varied timesteps, and event-driven friendliness.
- Our work is the **first to report large model results** (VGGSNN, cifar10-dvs) on fully event-driven platforms.

CMViM: Contrastive Masked Vim Autoencoder for 3D Multi-modal Representation Learning for AD classification

Guangqian Yang, **Kangrui Du**, Zhihan Yang, Ye Du, Yongping Zheng, Shujun Wang 

[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16520) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- While many efforts were made on multimodal representation learning for medical datasets, few discussions are made to 3D medical images.
- Introduced *Mamba SSM* and *contrastive learning* in multimodal masked pre-training for 3D ViT. Our method surpassed current SOTA methods in multimodal diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.
