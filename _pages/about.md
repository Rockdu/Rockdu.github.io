Hi! My name is Kangrui Du, a fourth-year undergraduate in Computer Science and Technology at the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). I'm a member of [Brain and Intelligence Lab](https://guslab.org/) at [(UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Shi Gu](https://guslab.org/). I'm a research intern at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/) where I'm fortunate to work with [Prof. Shujun Wang](https://emma-sjwang.github.io/). I'm also passionate about programming contests and was a member of the UESTC ACM-ICPC team.
<!-- My research interests lie in building, analyzing, and applying efficient and low-energy intelligent systems, including spiking neural networks, efficient AI, and medical image analysis.  -->

Temporal Flexibility in Spiking Neural Networks: A Novel Training Method for Enhanced Generalization Across Time Steps

***Kangrui Du**, *Yuhang Wu, Shikuang Deng, Shi Gu

[**Paper**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RmQAKu1wCe) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- Current methods restrict SNNs to fixed time steps, necessitating extra tuning and hindering real-time adjustments. 
- Our novel training method assigns time steps randomly to modules, mitigating their influence on inference, resulting in flexible SNNs that generalize across time steps and exhibit competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<!-- - Existing methods only allow SNNs to operate at a specific time step. This entails extra fine-tuning when switching to another time step and hinders the run-time adjustment of time steps for energy-accuracy balance.
- We proposed a novel training method that randomly assigns time steps to different modules when forwarding to disentangle the influence of varying time steps from the inference process. 
- Our method yields temporal flexible SNNs that can generalize across time steps. The method also brings SNNs performance boost, exhibiting competitive performance compared to the SOTA methods. -->
